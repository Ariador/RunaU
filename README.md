RunaU Regular Font is a Runic scripts which includes turned and mirrored runes. All variants of Futhark runes are included: Elder, Younger and Medieval and some newly invented Runic (dotted) symbols, too - 207 glyphs in total. All of them are available on keyboard in English (US) and Ukrainian (plus RightAlt modifier key) layouts.

Reversed and mirrored runes can be useful for those runologists using them for occult purpose but also they are used in my special project which is to be uploaded in a separate repository soon.
